      <p>
        You know, I was mostly just sleeping 😴 in class, barely paying attention to anything.<br>
        I only knew your name because of my friends, and honestly, the way they talked about you, I never imagined we'd even cross paths. But then, one day, I saw you in the corridor with Prasmi. <br>
        I didn’t even see your face—just your red-dyed hair ❤️‍🔥—and something about you made me ask, “Who is she?” When Prasmi said, “That’s Twisha,” <br>
        it was like a switch flipped.<br>
        Suddenly, I started noticing you everywhere, like the universe wanted me to.<br>
        Our classrooms were right in front of each other, and I couldn’t help but stare 👀. Then came the trip, and somehow, I always ended up near you.<br>
        That’s when I knew—I had to talk to you. And I’m so glad I did. ❤️

    Our house dates have always been our little haven, <br>
    where time slows down, and all we do is lose ourselves in each other.<br>
    The way your lips feel against mine, it's like nothing else matters in the world.<br>
    🔥 It’s the perfect kind of escape, and I never want it to end. 💕
