      <p><p>You know, I was mostly just sleeping 😴 in class, barely paying attention to anything.<br>> I only knew your name because of my friends, and honestly, the way they talked about you, I never imagined we'd even cross paths. But then, one day, I saw you in the corridor with Prasmi. <br>I didn’t even see your face—just your red-dyed hair ❤️‍🔥—and something about you made me ask, “Who is she?” When Prasmi said, “That’s Twisha,” <br>it was like a switch flipped<br> Suddenly, I started noticing you everywhere, like the universe wanted me to.<br>Our classrooms were right in front of each other, and I couldn’t help but stare 👀. Then came the trip, and somehow, I always ended up near you.<br>That’s when I knew—I had to talk to you. And I’m so glad I did. ❤️</p></p>

        <p>Our house dates have always been our little haven, <br>where time slows down, and all we do is lose ourselves in each other.<br>The way your lips feel against mine, it's like nothing else matters in the world.<br> 🔥 It’s the perfect kind of escape, and I never want it to end. 💕
